What is more important: rushing to complete as many cards as possible? 
Or making sure you fully understand the work? And Why?



Fully understanding the work is more important, because the purpose of this way of learning is to help people 
establish a successful career in the tech industry, through learning using the cards, also we are trained to work in
time based paradigm, where one should be competent enough to meeting the deadlines, still producing high quality work.
So rushing to complete the cards does not only defeat the purpose, it also has a negative impact on the skills you are
learning as you are learning to answer the questions NOT learning to understand and know the concepts, such that you can 
solve pretty much all the problems that you might encounter.
